# Sprint 5 Phase 1: Architecture Enhancement

**Phase Duration**: Days 1-2 (July 29-30, 2025)
**Lead Agent**: team-p2-architecture-coordinator
**Story Points**: Architecture planning (not counted in development points)

## Phase 1 Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Design AI service integration architecture with abstraction layer
2. Plan Elasticsearch cluster scaling for advanced search features
3. Define SignalR hub patterns for real-time collaboration
4. Establish workflow engine database schema and service architecture
5. Design field-level encryption implementation approach

### Architecture Deliverables

#### 1. AI Service Integration Architecture
```yaml
AI_Service_Layer:
  abstraction:
    - interface: IDocumentAIService
    - providers: OpenAI, Claude, Azure OpenAI
    - fallback: Local ML models
  
  components:
    - AIServiceFactory: Provider selection
    - AIPromptBuilder: Template management
    - AIResponseParser: Structured output
    - AIMetricsCollector: Performance tracking
  
  security:
    - API key management via Azure Key Vault
    - Request rate limiting
    - Token usage monitoring
    - Data sanitization
```

#### 2. Advanced Search Architecture
```yaml
Search_Infrastructure:
  elasticsearch:
    - cluster_size: 3 nodes minimum
    - index_strategy: Per-tenant indices
    - mapping: Dynamic with strict types
    
  search_features:
    - faceted_filtering: Category, date, author, tags
    - full_text: Title, content, metadata
    - aggregations: Document statistics
    - suggestions: Auto-complete, did-you-mean
```

#### 3. Real-Time Collaboration Architecture
```yaml
Collaboration_Service:
  signalr_hubs:
    - DocumentHub: Real-time editing
    - PresenceHub: User awareness
    - CommentHub: Threaded discussions
    
  conflict_resolution:
    - CRDT implementation
    - Operational transformation
    - Version vector clocks
    
  scalability:
    - Redis backplane
    - Sticky sessions
    - Azure SignalR Service ready
```

#### 4. Workflow Engine Architecture
```yaml
Workflow_Engine:
  core_components:
    - WorkflowDefinitionService
    - WorkflowExecutionEngine
    - WorkflowStateManager
    - WorkflowNotificationService
  
  database_schema:
    - workflow_definitions
    - workflow_instances
    - workflow_steps
    - workflow_transitions
    - workflow_assignments
```

#### 5. Security Enhancement Architecture
```yaml
Security_Features:
  field_encryption:
    - AES-256-GCM encryption
    - Per-field encryption keys
    - Key rotation strategy
    
  audit_analytics:
    - Real-time event streaming
    - Anomaly detection rules
    - Compliance dashboards
```

### Technical Decisions

#### Technology Choices
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 primary, Claude fallback
- **Search Backend**: Elasticsearch 8.x with security enabled
- **Real-Time**: SignalR with Redis backplane
- **Workflow Storage**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexibility
- **Encryption**: .NET Cryptography with Azure Key Vault

#### Architecture Patterns
- **AI Services**: Strategy pattern with factory
- **Search**: Repository pattern with specification
- **Collaboration**: Event sourcing with CQRS
- **Workflow**: State machine pattern
- **Security**: Decorator pattern for encryption

### Integration Points

#### API Endpoints Structure
```
/api/v2/ai/
  - generate
  - complete
  - analyze
  
/api/v2/search/
  - query
  - facets
  - suggestions
  
/api/v2/collaboration/
  - hubs/document
  - hubs/presence
  
/api/v2/workflow/
  - definitions
  - instances
  - transitions
```

### Risk Mitigation

#### Identified Risks
1. **AI Service Costs**: Implement token limits and caching
2. **Search Performance**: Index optimization and query caching
3. **Real-Time Scale**: Horizontal scaling with SignalR
4. **Workflow Complexity**: Modular design with extensions
5. **Security Overhead**: Async encryption operations
