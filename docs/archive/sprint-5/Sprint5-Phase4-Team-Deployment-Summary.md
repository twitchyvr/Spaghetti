## Performance Target Enforcement Framework

### Mandatory Sprint 5 KPIs - ACTIVE MONITORING
- **AI Response Time**: <2 seconds (95th percentile) - Backend Team
- **Search Response Time**: <100ms (95th percentile) - Backend/DevOps Teams
- **Collaboration Latency**: <50ms (95th percentile) - Backend/DevOps Teams
- **UI Response Time**: <1 second for all interactions - Frontend Team
- **System Availability**: >99.9% uptime - DevOps Team

### Performance Monitoring Dashboard - READY
- Real-time metrics collection active
- Automated alerting for target violations
- Weekly performance review scheduled
- Regression detection with baseline comparison

## Cross-Team Coordination Framework

### Daily Standup Protocol - ACTIVE
**Time**: 9:00 AM PST  
**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Participants**: All team leads + Team Orchestrator

**Agenda Template**:
1. Critical path progress (5 minutes)
2. Cross-team dependencies status (10 minutes)
3. Blocker identification and resolution (10 minutes)
4. Performance target validation (5 minutes)

### Integration Checkpoints
- **2:00 PM PST**: Dependency status check (leads only)
- **End of Day**: Progress commit and documentation update
- **Weekly**: Formal milestone review and quality gate assessment

## Quality Gate Management

### Week 1 Quality Gate (August 5, 2025)
**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Elasticsearch cluster operational with search <100ms
- [ ] AI provider abstraction layer functional
- [ ] SignalR hub responding with <50ms latency
- [ ] All development environments configured
- [ ] Initial integration tests passing

**Gate Owner**: Team Orchestrator  
**Review Process**: All team leads must sign off on deliverables

### Week 2-4 Quality Gates
