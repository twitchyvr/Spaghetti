# Enterprise Platform Vision

Building the Multi-Level Enterprise Documentation Platform

## Vision Statement

We are building the **Salesforce of Enterprise Documentation** - a comprehensive, AI-powered platform that enables large organizations to manage documentation across complex organizational structures.
