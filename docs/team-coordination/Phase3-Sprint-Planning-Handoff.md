## Phase 3 Objectives for team-p3-sprint-planner

### Primary Objectives
1. **Detailed Task Breakdown**: Convert 130 story points into specific, actionable tasks
2. **Sprint Planning**: Organize tasks into implementable sprints with dependencies
3. **Resource Allocation**: Assign tasks based on team capacity and expertise
4. **Timeline Establishment**: Create realistic timelines with buffer for complexity
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential blockers and mitigation strategies

### Sprint Planning Recommendations
- **Sprint 1**: Foundation setup (AI services, Elasticsearch, SignalR infrastructure)
- **Sprint 2**: Core feature implementation (document generation, search, collaboration)
- **Sprint 3**: Advanced features (workflows, security, analytics)
- **Sprint 4**: Integration testing, performance optimization, deployment

### Success Criteria for Phase 3
- Comprehensive sprint backlog with detailed task definitions
- Clear assignment of tasks to team members with capacity validation
