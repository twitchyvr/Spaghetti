# Sprint Planning & Execution Framework

## Current Sprint Status

Refer to `project-status.yaml` for current sprint information and agent status.

## Sprint Planning Guidelines

### Sprint Structure
- **Duration**: 2-week sprints
- **Story Points**: 100-130 points per sprint
- **Team Allocation**: Backend (35%), Frontend (40%), DevOps (15%), QA (10%)

### Success Metrics
- **Technical Performance**: <2s builds, >90% test coverage, <100ms API response, 100% uptime
- **Feature Quality**: Performance targets met, user acceptance achieved
- **Business Impact**: >60% feature adoption, >4.5/5 user satisfaction, 100% customer retention

## Agent Coordination Framework

### Phase-Based Development (9-Phase Workflow)
1. **team-p1-project-initializer**: Project initialization and requirements gathering
2. **team-p2-architecture-coordinator**: Technical architecture design and review
3. **team-p3-sprint-planner**: Sprint planning and task distribution
4. **team-p4-development-coordinator**: Development execution and coordination
5. **team-p5-test-strategy-architect**: Testing strategy and quality assurance
6. **team-p6-deployment-orchestrator**: Deployment and release management
7. **team-p7-sprint-retrospective-facilitator**: Sprint review and improvement
8. **team-p8-system-maintenance-coordinator**: System maintenance and monitoring
9. **team-p9-workflow-termination-coordinator**: Workflow closure and documentation

### Supporting Agents
- **project-manager**: Overall project coordination
- **scrum-master**: Agile process facilitation
- **developer**: Code implementation
- **ui-designer**: User experience design
- **qa-engineer**: Quality assurance
- **gitops-orchestrator**: Version control operations
- **team-orchestrator**: Multi-agent coordination

## Sprint Execution Standards

### Development Standards
- All changes require atomic git commits with conventional commit messages
- Build and test locally before committing
- Maintain >90% test coverage
- Follow established code patterns and architecture

### Quality Gates
- TypeScript compilation must pass without errors
- All tests must pass
- Performance budgets must be met
- Security standards must be maintained

### Documentation Requirements
- Update relevant documentation for all changes
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md with sprint progress
- Update project-status.yaml for state changes
- Create/update technical documentation as needed
