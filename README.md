# Ambient AI Work Assistant

An AI-powered work assistant that passively observes professional work and automatically generates high-quality, structured, and context-aware documentation for legal professionals.

## Project Vision

**The Problem:** In high-stakes professional environments like legal and finance, the creation of documentation (client memos, case notes, meeting summaries) is critical but is also a manual, time-consuming chore that interrupts the flow of billable work and is prone to human error or omission.

**The Vision:** To create an "ambient" AI-powered work assistant that passively and securely observes a professional's work (voice conversations, on-screen activity, document interaction) and automatically generates high-quality, structured, and context-aware documentation. It transforms documentation from a required task into an effortless, auditable byproduct of normal work.

## Guiding Principles

- **Intuitive & Non-Intrusive:** The user experience must be incredibly simple. The assistant should feel like a natural extension of the workflow, not another complex tool to manage.
- **Enterprise-Grade Professionalism & Security:** The UI must be clean, modern, and inspire the highest level of confidence and trust, suitable for partners at a top-tier law firm. Security and confidentiality are paramount.
- **Targeted & Relevant:** The primary user persona for this PoC is a **Legal Professional (Paralegal, Associate, or Partner)**. The examples, workflow, templates, and generated content must be highly relevant to their daily tasks.
- **Clarity & Actionability:** The final generated document is the "hero" of this application. It must be well-structured, easy to read, and immediately useful, with clear action items and key takeaways.

## Enterprise Platform Specifications

This is a **production-ready enterprise platform** designed for deployment across multiple environments and client configurations. The platform must support cloud-hosted SaaS deployments as well as on-premises and behind-the-firewall custom installations for maximum security and compliance flexibility.

### Deployment Models

1. **Cloud-Hosted SaaS (Primary):** Multi-tenant architecture with enterprise-grade security, compliance, and scalability
2. **On-Premises Installation:** Self-contained deployment for maximum data sovereignty and security
3. **Hybrid Cloud:** Partial cloud services with on-premises data processing and storage
4. **Air-Gapped Environments:** Completely isolated installations for highly sensitive environments

## Version History
