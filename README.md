## Project Vision

**The Problem:** Large enterprises struggle to manage documentation across complex organizational structures. When companies have multiple subsidiaries, divisions, or acquire new companies, they need centralized control over documentation standards while enabling autonomous operation at the business unit level. Traditional solutions force organizations to choose between centralized control and operational flexibility.

**The Vision:** To build the first true multi-level enterprise documentation platform that enables large organizations to:
- **Manage Multiple Tenants**: Self-service creation and management of organizational units
- **Scale Through Growth**: Seamlessly add new tenants for acquisitions, mergers, and divisions  
- **Maintain Control**: Centralized subscription and compliance oversight across all business units
- **Ensure Security**: Complete tenant isolation with enterprise-grade audit trails

**The Business Model:** We serve enterprise clients (Fortune 5000 companies, large law firms, consulting groups) who pay for platform access and manage their own tenant ecosystems. Our focus is on client relationships, platform operations, and enterprise features - not individual user management.

### Admin API Endpoints

**Database Seeding:**
```bash
# Populate database with comprehensive sample data
POST /api/admin/seed-sample-data

# Check if sample data exists
GET /api/admin/sample-data-status

# Get database statistics and health
GET /api/admin/database-stats
```

**Production Preparation:**
```bash
# Clear ALL data for production deployment
# WARNING: This deletes everything except system roles
DELETE /api/admin/clear-all-data?confirmationToken=CONFIRM_DELETE_ALL_DATA

# Create initial admin user (only works on empty database)
POST /api/admin/create-admin-user
{
  "email": "admin@company.com",
  "firstName": "Admin",
  "lastName": "User"
}
```

### Demo Data Statistics
When seeded, the database contains:
- **3 Multi-Tenant Organizations** with different tiers and configurations
- **8 Professional Users** across legal, tech, and consulting industries
- **7 Comprehensive Documents** with realistic content and metadata
- **20+ Document Tags** for categorization and search
- **15+ Permission Entries** demonstrating role-based access
- **25+ Audit Entries** showing realistic user activity and document history

This sample data demonstrates the platform's multi-tenant capabilities, document management features, and comprehensive audit trails suitable for enterprise environments.

## Guiding Principles

- **Intuitive & Non-Intrusive:** The user experience must be incredibly simple. The assistant should feel like a natural extension of the workflow, not another complex tool to manage.
- **Enterprise-Grade Professionalism & Security:** The UI must be clean, modern, and inspire the highest level of confidence and trust, suitable for partners at a top-tier law firm. Security and confidentiality are paramount.
- **Targeted & Relevant:** The primary user persona for this PoC is a **Legal Professional (Paralegal, Associate, or Partner)**. The examples, workflow, templates, and generated content must be highly relevant to their daily tasks.
- **Clarity & Actionability:** The final generated document is the "hero" of this application. It must be well-structured, easy to read, and immediately useful, with clear action items and key takeaways.
