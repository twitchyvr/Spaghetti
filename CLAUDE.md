# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Your primary responsibility is ensuring agents maintain the INSTRUCTIONS.md file that serves as the operational guide for all other agents in the project ecosystem, including the `developer` agent, `project-manager` agent, `ui-designer` agent, `scrum-master` agent,and `qa-engineer` agent, as well as others that we might create later like the `gitops-engineer` agent.

## Project Overview

Enterprise Documentation Platform - A comprehensive AI-powered document generation system targeting legal professionals, with expansion planned for insurance, consulting, and other professional domains. This is a **production-ready enterprise platform** designed for multi-tenant deployment across various hosting environments.

## Deployment Information

- The current project's publicly accessible URL after being built and hosted is `https://spaghetti-platform-drgev.ondigitalocean.app/`
- You are supposed to always commit every change, document it/them, etc.. and then push to github; which at that point triggers a ~30-45 second build from DigitalOcean before it becomes available at `https://spaghetti-platform-drgev.ondigitalocean.app/` if the build is successful

- Git with conventional commit practices

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and start development environment
git clone <repository-url>
cd Spaghetti
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations
dotnet ef database update --project src/core/infrastructure

# Start frontend development server
cd src/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Development Services
- **API**: http://localhost:5001 (Swagger UI at /swagger)
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001 (Vite dev server with HMR)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on localhost:5432
- **Redis**: localhost:6379
- **Elasticsearch**: http://localhost:9200

- Professional dashboard displays with sample data and modern UI components
- All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Build completes in ~966ms with optimized output

## Version Control Practices

- Git is used for version control with continuous deployment to DigitalOcean
- Follow conventional commit messages for clarity and consistency
- Use the format: `type(scope): subject` (e.g., `feat(ui): add live context feed`)
- Types include: `feat` (feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `style` (formatting), `refactor` (code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature), `test` (adding missing tests), `chore` (maintenance tasks)
- Each commit should be atomic, focusing on a single change
- **CRITICAL**: Always build and test Docker locally before committing to prevent deployment failures
- Use branches for new features or bug fixes, merging into `master` when complete
- Ensure all code is well-documented and follows best practices for readability and maintainability
- Document all new features in CLAUDE.md and Version History section of README.md
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages following the established pattern
- Each commit should include the Claude Code attribution footer

## Development Best Practices

### Critical Workflow Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: For ANY changes, including desktop app window updates:
  - Always git commit changes with conventional commit messages
  - Create necessary feature branches
  - Create corresponding GitHub issues with proper labels
  - Open pull requests with comprehensive descriptions
  - Fully document all changes in relevant documentation
  - Create project milestones for significant features
  - Add tasks to the GitHub project board
  - Update the project wiki with technical details
  - Update all relevant files in the `docs/` directory
  - **Execute these steps EVERY SINGLE TIME you make updates**

### Code Quality Standards
1. **Before Coding**: Update todo list and mark tasks as in_progress
2. **During Development**: Follow repository patterns and clean architecture
3. **Local Testing**: ALWAYS test locally (npm run dev, docker-compose up) before committing
4. **Build Verification**: Ensure TypeScript compilation passes (npm run build) 
5. **Code Review**: Ensure proper error handling and logging
6. **Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md and README.md for significant changes
7. **Commit**: Use conventional commit messages with frequent commits

### CSS and Styling Guidelines
**CRITICAL**: Use consistent styling approaches - DO NOT mix inline styles with CSS classes
1. **Primary Approach**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all styling
2. **Custom Styles**: Only use custom CSS classes when Tailwind utilities are insufficient
3. **NO INLINE STYLES**: Never mix inline style objects with className-based styling
4. **Consistency**: All components should follow the same styling methodology
5. **Variables**: Use CSS custom properties (variables) only in dedicated CSS files, not inline
6. **Theme System**: Respect the existing theme.css variable system when using custom CSS

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Frontend tests
npm run test

# Integration tests with Docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Add new migration
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName --project src/core/infrastructure

# Update database
dotnet ef database update --project src/core/infrastructure

# Generate SQL script
dotnet ef migrations script --project src/core/infrastructure
```

### Performance & Security
- All database queries use parameterized statements
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Use async/await patterns for all I/O operations
- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Use HTTPS in all environments

## Repository Pattern Implementation

### Core Interfaces
- `IRepository<TEntity, TKey>`: Generic CRUD operations with pagination
- `IUnitOfWork`: Transaction management and repository coordination
- Domain-specific repositories: `IDocumentRepository`, `IUserRepository`, etc.

### Testing Approach
- In-memory database for unit tests
- Realistic test data using AutoFixture and Bogus
- Comprehensive coverage of repository methods
- Transaction rollback testing
- Concurrent access scenarios

### Error Handling
- Structured logging with Serilog
- Custom exceptions for business logic violations
- Automatic retry policies for transient failures
- Circuit breaker patterns for external service calls 
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features

## Development Best Practices
- Every change needs a git commit and a matching doc update. Leave a clear trail for code, reviews, tests, and all enhancements.
- Use feature flags for incomplete features to avoid breaking changes
- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Use semantic versioning for releases
- Maintain a clean and organized codebase with consistent formatting
- Use pull requests for all changes, with at least one reviewer
- Keep the codebase modular and decoupled to facilitate testing and maintenance 
- Use environment variables for configuration to avoid hardcoding sensitive data
- Regularly back up critical data and configurations
- Always build and test the docker build locally before committing to git and pushing to origin, but do that every single time.

## Version History Tracking
- Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` file to track all changes, features, and bug fixes
- Use the following format for entries:
```markdown
## [Unreleased] 
### Added
- New feature description
### Changed
- Description of changes made
### Fixed
- Description of bug fixes
```
- Ensure each entry is linked to a specific commit or pull request for traceability

# Important Instruction Reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
