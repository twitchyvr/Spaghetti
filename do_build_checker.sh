# DigitalOcean App/Project Build Status Checker
#
# This script queries the DigitalOcean public API to gather detailed information
# about a given App Platform application and its associated project. It
# retrieves the list of apps in your account, resolves the ID of the app by
# name, fetches detailed app metadata, enumerates every deployment (build)
# triggered by GitHub pushes or manual actions, and fetches information for
# each deployment such as phase, progress, cause and timing statistics. It
# also looks up project details and lists all resources attached to the project.
#
# Results are saved as raw JSON files in the current working directory and
# human-readable summaries are printed to the terminal using jq. The script
# expects your DigitalOcean API token to be supplied via the
# DIGITALOCEAN_API_KEY or DO_API_TOKEN environment variable. For JSON
# formatting it depends on the jq command line tool â€“ install it with
# `brew install jq` on macOS if it is not available.
#
# References:
#  - The DigitalOcean public API exposes endpoints to list apps
#    (`GET /v2/apps`) and fetch details of a specific app by ID
#    (`GET /v2/apps/{id}`). Once an app is
#    identified, its deployments (builds) can be listed via
#    `GET /v2/apps/{app_id}/deployments` and a specific deployment can be
#    retrieved with `GET /v2/apps/{app_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}`.
#  - Projects and their resources are accessible via `GET /v2/projects/{project_id}`
#    and `GET /v2/projects/{project_id}/resources`.
