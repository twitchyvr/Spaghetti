# INSTRUCTIONS.md - Project Context & Coordination

**Version**: 0.0.16-alpha
**Status**: üöÄ Sprint 6 Active - Source of Truth Migrated to YAML

## ‚ùó CRITICAL UPDATE: Project Source of Truth

**All project stakeholders and agents MUST read this.**

To resolve inconsistencies and establish a definitive guide for all development, this project now uses a master YAML configuration file as its **single source of truth**.

### **Primary Reference: `project-architecture.yaml`**

This file, located in the root directory, contains the complete, up-to-date configuration for every aspect of the Spaghetti Platform, including:

- **Project Vision & Status**
- **Technology Stack & Architecture**
- **UI/UX Design System (The Pantry)**
- **Development Workflows & Quality Gates**
- **Security & Compliance Standards**
- **Active Sprint Goals & Lifecycle**

**Before starting any task, consult `project-architecture.yaml` first.**

### AI Agent Instructions

- **Developer Agents (Claude, Gemini, etc.)**: Your detailed operational instructions for implementing features based on the master YAML file are located in **`CLAUDE.md`** and **`GEMINI.md`**. You MUST adhere to the workflow defined in those files.
- **Orchestrator Agents**: You are to use `project-architecture.yaml` to generate context and instructions for all other agents.

### Team Coordination

Refer to the `teamAndRoles` and `sprintLifecycle` sections within `project-architecture.yaml` for current team assignments and sprint objectives. The `docs/` directory contains detailed supplementary documentation, but **`project-architecture.yaml` is the authoritative source in case of any conflict.**

- **Noodles**: Individual documents
- **Plates**: Document collections
- **The Kitchen**: Admin interface
- **Al Dente Editor**: Rich text editing component
- **Chefs/Sous Chefs**: Admin roles
- **Diners**: End users
- **Stewards**: Content managers

### Target Users & Personas
See `/docs/ui-design-system.md` for detailed persona definitions including:
- Stella (Strategic Chef - Enterprise Admin)
- Carlos (Compliance Connoisseur)
- Tariq (Technical Writer Steward)
- Priya (Product Manager Steward)
- David (Developer Diner/Steward)
- Lauren (Learner Diner)

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation follows a three-tier system to ensure clarity for all agents and team members:

1.  **Tier 1: Living Core**: The essential, always-current files in the root directory. This is the default context for all operations. This includes:
    *   `project-architecture.yaml` (The Source of Truth)
    *   `README.md` (Project Overview)
    *   **Agent Definitions** (e.g., `backend-lead.md`, `documentation-strategist.md`, etc.)
    *   `INSTRUCTIONS.md` (This File) and `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md` (AI Manuals)

2.  **Tier 2: Working Sprint**: Documents related to the *current* sprint are located directly in `docs/`. These provide immediate context for ongoing work.

3.  **Tier 3: The Archive**: All historical documents from past sprints are preserved in `docs/archive/sprint-X/`. **This archive should only be referenced when historical context is explicitly requested.**

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (.NET Core 8)
- ASP.NET Core Web API with Swagger/OpenAPI
- PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core
- Redis for caching and session management
- Elasticsearch for search and indexing

- >90% test coverage required
- <2s build times maintained
- Repository pattern implementation
- Clean architecture principles

### Version Control
- Conventional commit messages required
- Feature branches for development
- Atomic commits with documentation updates
- Git commit and push triggers DigitalOcean deployment

### Performance Requirements
