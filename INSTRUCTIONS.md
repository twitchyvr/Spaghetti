# INSTRUCTIONS.md - Project Context & Coordination

**Version**: 0.0.17-alpha  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Phase 1 Backend Enhancement Complete - Service Integration & Database Connectivity

## ‚ùó CRITICAL UPDATE: Project Source of Truth

**All project stakeholders and agents MUST read this.**

To resolve inconsistencies and establish a definitive guide for all development, this project now uses a master YAML configuration file as its **single source of truth**.

### **Primary Reference: `project-architecture.yaml`**

This file, located in the root directory, contains the complete, up-to-date configuration for every aspect of the Spaghetti Platform, including:

- **Project Vision & Status**
- **Technology Stack & Architecture**
- **UI/UX Design System (The Pantry)**
- **Development Workflows & Quality Gates**
- **Security & Compliance Standards**
- **Active Sprint Goals & Lifecycle**

**Before starting any task, consult `project-architecture.yaml` first.**

### AI Agent Instructions

- **Developer Agents (Claude, Gemini, etc.)**: Your detailed operational instructions for implementing features based on the master YAML file are located in **`CLAUDE.md`** and **`GEMINI.md`**. You MUST adhere to the workflow defined in those files.
- **Orchestrator Agents**: You are to use `project-architecture.yaml` to generate context and instructions for all other agents.

### Team Coordination

Refer to the `teamAndRoles` and `sprintLifecycle` sections within `project-architecture.yaml` for current team assignments and sprint objectives. The `docs/` directory contains detailed supplementary documentation, but **`project-architecture.yaml` is the authoritative source in case of any conflict.**

## Project Overview

**Spaghetti Platform** - Enterprise Documentation Platform targeting legal professionals with expansion planned for insurance, consulting, and other domains. Production-ready multi-tenant platform designed for various hosting environments.

- **Live URL**: <https://spaghetti-platform-drgev.ondigitalocean.app/>
- **Repository**: Production-ready enterprise documentation system
- **Technology**: .NET Core 8 backend, React 18 TypeScript frontend
  - NOTE: Use the installed `shot-scraper` python command line tool (Documentation is at <https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/>) to capture screenshots of the deployed platform when needed. You *MUST* use `--wait 5000` to ensure the page is fully loaded before capturing.

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation follows a three-tier system to ensure clarity for all agents and team members:

1.  **Tier 1: Living Core**: The essential, always-current files in the root directory. This is the default context for all operations. This includes:
    *   `project-architecture.yaml` (The Source of Truth)
    *   `README.md` (Project Overview)
    *   **Agent Definitions** (e.g., `backend-lead.md`, `documentation-strategist.md`, etc.)
    *   `INSTRUCTIONS.md` (This File) and `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md` (AI Manuals)

2.  **Tier 2: Working Sprint**: Documents related to the *current* sprint are located directly in `docs/`. These provide immediate context for ongoing work.

3.  **Tier 3: The Archive**: All historical documents from past sprints are preserved in `docs/archive/sprint-X/`. **This archive should only be referenced when historical context is explicitly requested.**

## Technical Architecture
